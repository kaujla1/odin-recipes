# odin-recipes

The purpose of this project is to create a very simple website that contains a few different recipes.

From completing this project I've learned/practiced:

    - How to setup a simple html boilerplate
    - How to structure webpage content using h1, h2, p, img, ul, ol, etc. 
    - How to add relative links from the index.html (homepage) file to other files (webpages)
    - How and when to commit changes using git
    - How to create/organize files/directories using the command line
    - Probably a lot more that I can't think of right now lol
